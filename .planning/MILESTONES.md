**Phases completed:** 3 phases (15-17), 16 plans
**Timeline:** 2 days (2026-03-06 → 2026-03-07)
**Files changed:** 268 (26,546 insertions, 1,859 deletions) since v1.1
**Git tag:** v1.2.0

**Delivered:** Template portability and AI co-authoring — users can export/import templates as tenant-neutral JSON, generate templates via in-app AI chat in their company language, and access a copyable DIY prompt kit for external AI tools.

**Key accomplishments:**
1. TemplateExport interface + `buildExportPayload()` — TDD-validated UUID stripping and portable JSON contract (EXP-02 through EXP-05)
2. Export API (`GET /api/templates/[id]/export`) + `/templates/schema` docs page — 3-tab JSON Schema/Methodology/Weights in EN+RO
3. ExportButton component with role-gating (admin/manager only), hover-reveal on template cards and editor toolbar
4. Template import pipeline — `templateImportSchema` Zod validation, `derivePreviewStats`, conflict detection, atomic insert with audit log
5. Multi-step ImportDialog — language mismatch warning, rename/copy/cancel conflict resolution, field-specific validation errors
6. AI template editor — chat→generate→preview→save with company language awareness, version history, resizable panels
7. DIY Prompt Kit tab — copyable schema + methodology + worked example for Claude, ChatGPT, etc.
