## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time video/audio | Competing with Zoom/Teams is suicidal. Run wizard alongside video call. |
| AI meeting transcription | Structured questionnaire approach IS the alternative. Transcripts produce noisy data. |
| Full HRIS integration | HRIS integrations are a swamp. CSV import for bulk users suffices. |
| Anonymous peer feedback / 360 | Poisons the 1:1 trust relationship. Separate product category. |
| OKR / goal tracking | Separate product category. Reference goals as free text in notes. |
| Gamification (badges, leaderboards) | Trivializes professional conversations. Use subtle progress indicators instead. |
| Slack bot replacing session wizard | Chat answers produce lower-quality responses than the focused wizard UX. |
| Manager scoring / ranking | Creates perverse incentives. Show managers their own trends privately. |
| Mobile native app | Web responsive is sufficient for v1. Native if mobile demand is proven. |
| Multi-language (i18n) | English-only until international expansion. |
