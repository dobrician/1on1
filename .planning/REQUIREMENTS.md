# Requirements: 1on1 — v1.4 Session Corrections & Accountability

**Defined:** 2026-03-10
**Core Value:** The AI context layer that makes every meeting smarter than the last

---

## v1.4 Requirements

### Correction Data & Storage (CORR)

- [ ] **CORR-01**: User can view which answers in a completed session have been corrected via an "Amended" badge on each modified answer row
- [x] **CORR-02**: System preserves the original answer value (text/numeric/json) in an append-only history table — original value is never overwritten or destroyed
- [ ] **CORR-03**: Manager (and admins) can view a correction history panel on a session detail page showing all amendments with timestamps, actor, and reason

### Correction Workflow (WFLOW)

- [x] **WFLOW-01**: Manager can initiate a correction for any answer in a completed session they conducted; admins can correct any session in the tenant
- [x] **WFLOW-02**: Manager must provide an explicit correction reason (20–500 characters) before submitting — empty or too-short reasons are rejected
- [x] **WFLOW-03**: AI validates the correction reason for quality, relevance, and company language compliance before the correction can be submitted
- [ ] **WFLOW-04**: Manager sees inline AI feedback on the reason field (pass/fail + one-sentence note) without navigating away from the session
- [ ] **WFLOW-05**: Correction form shows the original and new answer values side by side inline on the session detail page — no separate page navigation required

### Notification & Accountability (NOTIF)

- [ ] **NOTIF-01**: Report (employee) receives an email notification with a session link when any of their session answers is corrected
- [ ] **NOTIF-02**: All active tenant admins receive an email notification when a session answer is corrected
- [x] **NOTIF-03**: A `session.answer_corrected` audit log event is written inside the same database transaction as the correction — no correction exists without an audit record
- [ ] **NOTIF-04**: Multiple corrections to the same session within a 5-minute window result in a single email per recipient, not one email per answer

### Analytics Integrity (ANLT)

- [x] **ANLT-01**: When a numeric answer is corrected, the session score is recalculated in-transaction and the analytics snapshot is refreshed asynchronously after commit

---

## Future Requirements

### Governance

- **GOV-01**: Admin can hard-lock a completed session to prevent further corrections (compliance freeze)
- **GOV-02**: Report can acknowledge or formally dispute a correction submitted by the manager

### Export & Integration

- **EXP-01**: Correction history included in CSV export of session data
- **EXP-02**: `session.answer_corrected` webhook event for external integrations (v3 public API)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Report can correct their own session answers | Enables score manipulation; the audit trail + manager correction path is the accountability mechanism |
| Bulk correction across multiple sessions | High risk of data integrity abuse; corrections should be deliberate per-session actions |
| Corrections to shared notes or private notes | Notes are narrative text, not structured answers; separate correction semantics needed — defer to v2 |
| AI correction reason required to be perfect | AI validates quality and language; minor wording issues should not block a legitimate correction |
| Email includes inline before/after answer content | Sensitive answer text should not appear in email provider logs — link-only notification is the privacy-safe default |
