# Roadmap: 1on1

## Overview

Transform the validated Google Forms 1:1 meeting workflow into an AI-native SaaS product where the AI context layer makes every meeting smarter than the last. The roadmap builds from data foundation through the core session wizard to AI features, following the principle that structured data collection enables everything else. Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability. AI ships in v1 as a core feature, not a bolt-on.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
