**Current focus:** v1.4 Session Corrections & Accountability — Phase 24 ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 24 of 27 (Schema Foundation) — not started
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan Phase 24

Progress: [████████████████░░░░░░░░░░] 62% (phases 1-21 complete, 22-27 pending)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.3 reference):**
- Total plans completed: 85 (v1.0: 40 + v1.1: 13 + v1.2: 16 + v1.3: 16 to date)
- Average duration: ~6-8 min per plan
- Total execution time: ~7h (v1.2), similar expected for v1.3/v1.4

**By Phase (recent):**

| Phase | Plans | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 18-critical-bugs | 3/3 | Complete |
| 19-design-system | 3/3 | Complete |
| 20-mobile-responsiveness | 4/4 | Complete |
| 21-content-data-display | 4/4 | Complete |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.4 roadmap]: Phases 24-27 — schema first, then API, then email, then UI; strict dependency chain
- [v1.4 roadmap]: AI validation runs via separate `/validate-reason` endpoint — AI outages do not block the mutation
- [v1.4 roadmap]: Email uses link-only format (no inline answer content) — privacy-safe per research finding
- [v1.4 roadmap]: 5-minute session-level email deduplication — one email per session window, not per answer
- [v1.3 roadmap]: Phase 22 depends on Phase 19 — ERR-01 (404 page) uses DES-04 empty-state component
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: Direct tenant_id on history table (not join-based) required for FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY to block adminDb superuser bypass
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: No many(sessionAnswerHistories) relation added to sessions.ts to avoid circular imports
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: drizzle-kit generate NOT run after enums.ts update — hand-written ALTER TYPE migration required in plan 24-02

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1.3 phases 22-23 must complete before v1.4 phases 24-27 begin (Phase 24 depends on Phase 23)
- Phase 25 AI prompt design: review current `generateObject` patterns in `src/lib/ai/service.ts` before coding (15-min review flagged by research)
