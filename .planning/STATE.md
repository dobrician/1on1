## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used npx for scaffolding then converted to Bun (bun x interactive prompt issues)
- [01-01]: ESM import for ws module instead of require() for TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui Neutral base color chosen (aligns with minimalistic design philosophy)
- [01-02]: Applied migrations via psql instead of drizzle-kit migrate (Neon driver cannot connect to local PostgreSQL)
- [01-02]: Private note RLS uses RESTRICTIVE tenant + permissive author-only (AND logic)
- [01-02]: Junction table RLS via subquery JOIN to parent table for tenant isolation
- [01-03]: Used node-postgres (pg) for seed script instead of Neon driver (WebSocket not available locally)
- [01-03]: Deterministic UUIDs in seed data for idempotent re-runs via onConflictDoUpdate
- [01-03]: Seed connects as postgres superuser via SEED_DATABASE_URL to bypass RLS
- [Roadmap]: AI ships in v1 (phases 7-8), not deferred to v3 -- core product differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6, 7, 9 can execute in parallel after Phase 5 (all depend only on Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Google Calendar integration deferred to v2 per REQUIREMENTS.md (not in v1 scope)
- [Roadmap]: Design-first approach applied per-phase (mockups within each phase's plans, not a separate phase)
- [02-01]: Auth.js adapter requires exact column names: added 'name' and 'emailVerified' to user table
- [02-01]: Accounts table uses snake_case property names to match @auth/drizzle-adapter type expectations
- [02-01]: DrizzleAdapter cast to NextAuthConfig['adapter'] for @auth/core version mismatch workaround
- [02-01]: Resend client lazy-initialized to prevent build-time errors when API key is not set
- [02-01]: Token tables have no RLS -- accessed in unauthenticated flows (registration, password reset)
- [02-01]: OAuth sign-in blocked for users without existing records (must register org with credentials first)
- [02-02]: proxy.ts uses Next.js 16 convention (export const proxy) -- confirmed server looks for proxy first, then middleware
- [02-02]: Dashboard layout validates session server-side as defense-in-depth (CVE-2025-29927 mitigation)
- [02-02]: emailVerified added to JWT/session for verification status display in dashboard
- [02-03]: org_type is a dedicated column, not JSONB settings — structural property affecting business logic
- [02-03]: All auth flows use server actions with server-side redirects — no client-side next-auth/react URL construction
- [02-03]: trustHost: true in Auth.js config + X-Forwarded-Host/Proto reading in proxy.ts for reverse proxy
- [02-03]: Switched from Resend to nodemailer — works with any SMTP provider (smtp2go)
- [02-03]: Email base URLs derived from request headers, not hardcoded NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- [02-03]: orgType immutable after registration (set once, read-only in settings page)
- [03-01]: audit_log is immutable: RLS policies allow SELECT/INSERT only, no UPDATE/DELETE
- [03-01]: invite_token has no DELETE RLS policy: invites expire or get accepted, never deleted
- [03-01]: TransactionClient type exported from tenant-context.ts for audit helper reuse
- [03-01]: Sidebar has three nav items: Overview, People, Settings (minimal for v1)
- [Phase 03]: Accept endpoint uses adminDb with manual SET LOCAL for RLS (no session for unauthenticated users)
- [Phase 03]: Email verified automatically on invite acceptance (trusted invite link)
- [Phase 03]: 2-step wizard validates password fields before advancing to profile step
- [03-03]: Client-side filtering for v1: Server Component fetches all users, TanStack Table handles sorting/filtering/pagination
- [03-03]: URL-based tab navigation: /people for People tab, /teams for Teams tab
- [03-03]: Profile editing on dedicated page, ProfileSheet is read-only quick view
- [03-03]: PATCH endpoint dispatches on body keys (role, managerId, isActive, profile fields)
- [03-04]: Sidebar restructured with Settings section header and role-based visibility via useSession
- [03-04]: Audit log uses server-side pagination (page/limit params) -- audit logs grow large over time
- [03-04]: Team detail page splits Server Component (data fetch) and Client Component (interactivity)

- [04-01]: Soft-delete pattern for templates: is_archived=true, never actual row deletion (preserves session history)
- [04-01]: Answer config validation at API level: multiple_choice enforces min 2 non-empty string options
- [04-01]: Template list uses LEFT JOIN with COUNT for question counts, filtering archived questions
- [04-01]: DELETE endpoint on templates is archive (soft-delete), unsetting is_default if needed
- [Phase 04]: Versioning only triggers when template has sessions AND questions changed -- unused templates update in place
- [Phase 04]: Duplicate uses two-pass approach: insert all questions for new IDs, then remap conditional references
- [Phase 04]: Questions managed in local React state (not RHF field arrays), saved in batch via single PATCH
- [04-03]: @dnd-kit/modifiers used for restrictToVerticalAxis (separate package from @dnd-kit/core)
- [04-03]: ConditionalLogicForm uses local state with useEffect propagation, not RHF controlled
- [04-03]: Operators filtered client-side (dropdown) and server-side (validateConditionalLogic) via shared operatorsForAnswerType

- [05-01]: shared_notes migrated from TEXT to JSONB with backward-compatible USING clause (existing text wrapped in {general: text})
- [05-01]: Per-category data: category VARCHAR(50) on private_note, talking_point, action_item (not enum for flexibility)
- [05-01]: One active series per manager+report pair (API check + DB unique index on tenant+manager+report)
- [05-01]: Start session creates in_progress immediately with auto-incremented session number
- [05-01]: Zod v4 z.coerce incompatible with @hookform/resolvers -- use explicit interface + parseInt handlers
- [05-01]: Migration applied via Docker exec (psql not available on host)
- [05-02]: Wizard state managed via single useReducer at shell level -- enables cross-category conditional logic and centralized answer tracking
- [05-02]: navigator.sendBeacon used for beforeunload save -- reliable on page close without auth header limitations
- [05-02]: Category order derived from first question sortOrder appearance -- canonical ordering prevents display inconsistencies
- [05-02]: answerNumeric stored as string in DB (decimal column) but exposed as number in API responses
- [05-03]: Context panel uses Collapsible sections (not tabs) for simultaneous multi-section visibility
- [05-03]: Previous answers collapsed by default on category steps to reduce visual noise
- [05-03]: Recharts sparkline uses hidden YAxis with domain padding for visual spread
- [05-03]: Mobile context panel uses fixed slide-in overlay with backdrop, triggered by floating action button
- [05-04]: Tiptap editors use immediatelyRender: false to prevent SSR hydration mismatch
- [05-04]: Private notes stored as JSON-serialized EncryptedPayload in content column, decrypted server-side on GET
- [05-04]: Notes auto-save via useDebounce + visibilitychange flush for tab-switch data safety
- [05-04]: Aggregate save status via activeSavingCount in wizard reducer (INC_SAVING/DEC_SAVING actions)
- [05-05]: Score normalization uses SCORABLE_TYPES set to filter non-numeric types; returns null when no scorable answers
- [05-05]: Completion API computes score, duration, next_session_at in single transaction with audit logging
- [05-05]: Summary screen computes score client-side for display; server re-computes authoritatively on completion
- [05-05]: Wizard navigation hides Next button on summary step; Complete Session button in summary screen handles final action

- [06-01]: Drizzle alias() for self-join on users table (assignee + report in single query)
- [06-01]: Optimistic update on status toggle: completed items removed from list immediately, then query invalidated
- [06-01]: Sheet component (slide-in panel) for editing action items -- keeps user on the same page
- [06-01]: Two-state status model in UI (Open/Done) mapping to DB enum values (open/completed)
- [06-02]: Answers passed as Record (not Map) across server/client boundary -- Maps cannot be serialized
- [06-02]: History page uses manual fetch with URL state instead of useQuery for filter changes
- [06-02]: Private notes decrypted server-side in summary page, only author's notes fetched
- [06-02]: Cursor-based pagination uses scheduledAt+id for stable ordering
- [06-03]: websearch_to_tsquery for natural language query handling (handles quotes and minus operators)
- [06-03]: Shared notes searched on-the-fly via JSONB text extraction (no GIN index) -- acceptable for v1 volumes
- [06-03]: SearchTrigger dispatches synthetic Cmd+K keydown to toggle palette (avoids prop drilling/shared state)
- [06-03]: History search 500ms debounce vs command palette 300ms (focused browsing vs power-user UX)

- [07-01]: Migration written manually (drizzle-kit generate is interactive) -- consistent with prior phase pattern
- [07-01]: Model tiers: Sonnet for summaries/addendum/suggestions (quality), Haiku for nudges (cost-effective)
- [07-01]: Context builder uses withTenantContext with managerId as userId for RLS-compliant private note access
- [07-01]: Token budget: text answers truncated at 500 chars, notes at 1000 chars, history limited to 3 sessions
- [07-02]: Inngest step.run() serializes return values as JSON; rehydrateContext() helper reconstructs Date objects
- [07-02]: onFailure callback sets aiStatus to "failed" when Inngest pipeline exhausts all retries
- [07-02]: AI retry handler fetches session/series to reconstruct context (minimal event payload)
- [07-02]: Accepted AI suggestions create real action items; skipped suggestions permanently removed
- [07-01]: Zod schemas created in Task 1 to satisfy session table import type dependencies
- [07-03]: Cron uses adminDb for cross-tenant series scanning, fan-out via individual Inngest events per series
- [07-03]: Nudge refresh deletes non-dismissed nudges and inserts fresh ones (preserves dismissed)
- [07-03]: Dashboard fetches nudges via Server Component direct DB query (not API), following project data flow convention
- [07-03]: NudgeList in context panel uses TanStack Query (client component in existing client component tree)
- [07-03]: Nudge section only rendered for managers (nudges are manager-only per locked decision)
- [Phase 08]: Dashboard queries run in parallel within single withTenantContext; nudges batch-fetched by series IDs
- [Phase 08]: [08-01]: Delete-then-insert for analytics_snapshot upserts (NULL-safe unique index handling)
- [Phase 08]: [08-01]: Section name as category key -- template_section.name lowercased matches CATEGORY_METRICS keys
- [Phase 08]: [08-01]: Team averages require minimum 3 data points for anonymization
- [Phase 08]: [08-03]: Server Component loads initial 3mo data, client wrapper handles period changes via TanStack Query
- [Phase 08]: [08-03]: Category breakdown uses horizontal bar chart with HSL color rotation (60deg steps from primary)
- [Phase 08]: [08-03]: Session comparison is a delta table (not chart) per locked decision
- [Phase 08]: [08-04]: Added sampleCount to HeatmapDataPoint for dot sizing (missing from query layer)
- [Phase 08]: [08-04]: Team RBAC checks teams.managerId and team_member.role='lead' for manager access
- [Phase 08]: [08-05]: Velocity query uses EXTRACT(EPOCH) for timezone-safe day calculation
- [Phase 08]: [08-05]: Single /api/analytics/export endpoint handles all export types via type query parameter
- [Phase 08]: [08-05]: effectiveRole set to "member" when viewing specific user's velocity/adherence data
- [Phase 08]: [08-06]: Section name stored directly as metricName in snapshots (avoids lossy slug-to-display conversion)
- [Phase 08]: [08-06]: OPERATIONAL_METRICS exclusion set replaces CATEGORY_METRICS inclusion list (new categories auto-work)
- [Phase 08]: [08-06]: DISTINCT ON query for latest scores per report (avoids correlated subquery in GROUP BY)
- [07-04]: getManagerNudges is standalone query with no date filter -- nudges show regardless of upcoming sessions
- [07-04]: Wizard NudgeList fetches all non-dismissed nudges (no upcoming param) -- context panel shows full picture
- [07-04]: API upcoming filter uses IS NULL OR range check -- defensive fix for NULL targetSessionAt

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 7]: Google App Verification for calendar OAuth scopes takes 2-4 weeks -- initiate early if calendar moves to v1
- [Phase 1]: Neon default role has BYPASSRLS -- must create dedicated app role before any tenant data is written (RESOLVED: app_user created in 01-01, granted in 01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Private note key_version field missing from existing docs/data-model.md schema -- must be added (RESOLVED: added in 01-02 schema)
- [Phase 1]: drizzle-kit migrate does not work with local PostgreSQL (Neon driver requires WebSocket) -- use psql for local migrations
