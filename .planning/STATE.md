## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.4 roadmap]: Phases 24-27 — schema first, then API, then email, then UI; strict dependency chain
- [v1.4 roadmap]: AI validation runs via separate `/validate-reason` endpoint — AI outages do not block the mutation
- [v1.4 roadmap]: Email uses link-only format (no inline answer content) — privacy-safe per research finding
- [v1.4 roadmap]: 5-minute session-level email deduplication — one email per session window, not per answer
- [v1.3 roadmap]: Phase 22 depends on Phase 19 — ERR-01 (404 page) uses DES-04 empty-state component
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: Direct tenant_id on history table (not join-based) required for FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY to block adminDb superuser bypass
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: No many(sessionAnswerHistories) relation added to sessions.ts to avoid circular imports
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: drizzle-kit generate NOT run after enums.ts update — hand-written ALTER TYPE migration required in plan 24-02
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: Drizzle migration tracking gap fixed: registered migrations 0012-0017 manually in drizzle.__drizzle_migrations
- [Phase 24-schema-foundation]: Hand-written ALTER TYPE migration required — drizzle-kit generate cannot handle enum extension without breaking FK references
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: computeSessionScore already fully implemented — scoring tests discovered GREEN on first run, no implementation gap in plan 25-02
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: Zod schema tests (correctionInputSchema, validateReasonSchema, reasonValidationResultSchema) fail at import stage — correct RED behavior before plan 25-02/25-03 implementation
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: validateCorrectionReason throws on error — caller returns degraded { pass: true, feedback: null } so AI outages never block the correction mutation
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: correctionValidator uses claude-haiku-4-5 — short structured output, cost-effective tier
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: Zod v4 uses .issues not .errors on ZodError — corrected in both route files
- [Phase 25-core-api-business-logic]: validate-reason is auth-only (no series RBAC) — reason text advisory only, not sensitive; AI failures degrade to { pass: true, feedback: null }
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: i18n tests use toContain assertions on translated content to be genuinely RED before keys exist — not.toThrow() alone is insufficient since use-intl returns fallback strings
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: Dynamic import with try/catch used in test beforeEach to avoid hard module-not-found crash at test file load time
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: sendCorrectionEmails dedup check defaults to false on error — DB failures must not silently drop correction emails
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: sendCorrectionEmails accepts pre-resolved context — DB resolution is the API route layer's responsibility
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: IIFE pattern used for fire-and-forget in corrections route — allows multiple awaits for DB context resolution before calling sendCorrectionEmails
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: reportId, managerId, sessionNumber returned from withTenantContext result — zero extra DB calls added to hot path
- [Phase 26-email-notification-i18n]: adminDb used for post-commit email context resolution — operates outside RLS, appropriate for internal notification infrastructure
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: // @vitest-environment happy-dom required for correction UI test files — global vitest env is node, React rendering needs DOM
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: Submit-not-disabled test explicitly encodes AI-advisory-only requirement — Wave 2 must never block submission on AI validation result
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: AmendedBadge and CorrectionHistoryPanel use hardcoded strings — test files render without next-intl provider, useTranslations throws without provider
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: correctionsByAnswerId keyed by session_answers.id — allows O(1) lookup per answer row for AmendedBadge display
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: Submit button gated only by isPending — test spec explicitly encodes AI-advisory-only requirement; reason length omitted to match test contract
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: renderAnswerDisplay and SummaryAnswer exported from session-summary-view.tsx — shared display logic reused in AnswerCorrectionForm without duplication
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: Vitest exclude array: ['e2e/**', 'node_modules/**'] — without include/exclude, Vitest picks up Playwright specs; separate configs for separate runners
- [Phase 27-ui-integration]: Chainable adminDb mock in vi.mock factory returns select().from().where().limit() resolving to [] by default — sendCorrectionEmails tests inherit working dedup mock without explicit setup
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: @neondatabase/serverless Pool uses WebSocket incompatible with local PostgreSQL — detect via URL pattern (.neon.tech) and fall back to standard pg Pool for local dev
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Playwright fixtures approach preferred over project storageState for multi-role tests — fresh context per test enables role-switching within same spec
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: chromium project remains admin default; chromium-manager and chromium-member projects added for role-targeted test runs
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: User menu trigger identified by initials (AJ) — no aria-label on avatar button; getByRole('button', { name: /^AJ$/ }) is the correct selector
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Sign out is a Radix UI menuitem (role='menuitem'), not a button — getByRole('menuitem', { name: /sign out/ }) + waitFor required for logout flow
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Admin role sees series as informational links — no Start/Resume buttons; only owning manager sees action buttons on series cards
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Wizard spinner (.animate-spin) detection via waitForFunction required before asserting content — React Query async load pattern
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Session summary page is clean locally: HTTP 200, no crashes; duplicate React keys for Wellbeing/Performance noted in debug report (non-crashing)
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Amended badge test uses test.skip — seed answer UUIDs fail Zod uuid() validation (variant bits 6xxx vs RFC4122 required [89ab]xxx); documented fix path in deferred-items
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: debug spec targets dev server (port 4301) via adminPage fixture; session summary locally clean: HTTP 200, no crashes; neon_websocket hypothesis matched Next.js HMR ws:// (not Neon)
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Template create redirects to detail page — tests handle both list and detail outcomes after creation
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Archive button used instead of Delete — app uses Archive not Delete for template lifecycle
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Add Question requires section first — test explicitly adds section before attempting Add Question
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: GitHub Actions E2E workflow uses bun run test:e2e -- --project=setup --project=chromium for explicit project ordering; PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH set to /home/runner/.cache/ms-playwright in CI
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Seed UUID fix: DELETE old 6000-variant rows in seedAnswers() before insert — onConflictDoUpdate(id) cannot match old PKs when UUID constants change; required for idempotent re-seeding
- [Phase 28-playwright-e2e-test-suite]: Amended badge E2E test skip removed — seed UUID 8000-variant fix enables correction POST to return 200; setupComplete variable also removed (used only for skip)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- v1.3 phases 22-23 must complete before v1.4 phases 24-27 begin (Phase 24 depends on Phase 23)
- Phase 25 AI prompt design: review current `generateObject` patterns in `src/lib/ai/service.ts` before coding (15-min review flagged by research)
