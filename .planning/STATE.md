# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** The AI context layer that makes every meeting smarter than the last
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Infrastructure) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase -- ALL PLANS COMPLETE
Status: Phase 1 complete -- ready for Phase 2
Last activity: 2026-03-03 -- Phase 1 completed (checkpoint approved, port fix committed)

Progress: [▓▓▓░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.30 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-infrastructure | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (8 min), 01-02 (4 min), 01-03 (6 min)
- Trend: consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used npx for scaffolding then converted to Bun (bun x interactive prompt issues)
- [01-01]: ESM import for ws module instead of require() for TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui Neutral base color chosen (aligns with minimalistic design philosophy)
- [01-02]: Applied migrations via psql instead of drizzle-kit migrate (Neon driver cannot connect to local PostgreSQL)
- [01-02]: Private note RLS uses RESTRICTIVE tenant + permissive author-only (AND logic)
- [01-02]: Junction table RLS via subquery JOIN to parent table for tenant isolation
- [01-03]: Used node-postgres (pg) for seed script instead of Neon driver (WebSocket not available locally)
- [01-03]: Deterministic UUIDs in seed data for idempotent re-runs via onConflictDoUpdate
- [01-03]: Seed connects as postgres superuser via SEED_DATABASE_URL to bypass RLS
- [Roadmap]: AI ships in v1 (phases 7-8), not deferred to v3 -- core product differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6, 7, 9 can execute in parallel after Phase 5 (all depend only on Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Google Calendar integration deferred to v2 per REQUIREMENTS.md (not in v1 scope)
- [Roadmap]: Design-first approach applied per-phase (mockups within each phase's plans, not a separate phase)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 7]: Google App Verification for calendar OAuth scopes takes 2-4 weeks -- initiate early if calendar moves to v1
- [Phase 1]: Neon default role has BYPASSRLS -- must create dedicated app role before any tenant data is written (RESOLVED: app_user created in 01-01, granted in 01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Private note key_version field missing from existing docs/data-model.md schema -- must be added (RESOLVED: added in 01-02 schema)
- [Phase 1]: drizzle-kit migrate does not work with local PostgreSQL (Neon driver requires WebSocket) -- use psql for local migrations
