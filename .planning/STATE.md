# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** The AI context layer that makes every meeting smarter than the last
**Current focus:** Phase 4 - Questionnaire Templates

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 10 (Questionnaire Templates)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Plan 04-01 complete -- Template CRUD foundation built
Last activity: 2026-03-03 -- Plan 04-01 completed (template CRUD API, list page, sidebar nav)

Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░] 33%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 1.58 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-infrastructure | 3 | 18 min | 6 min |
| 02-authentication-organization | 3 | 59 min | 20 min |
| 03-user-team-management | 4 | 24 min | 6 min |
| 04-questionnaire-templates | 1 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-01 (5 min), 03-02 (6 min), 03-03 (6 min), 03-04 (7 min), 04-01 (5 min)
- Trend: consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used npx for scaffolding then converted to Bun (bun x interactive prompt issues)
- [01-01]: ESM import for ws module instead of require() for TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui Neutral base color chosen (aligns with minimalistic design philosophy)
- [01-02]: Applied migrations via psql instead of drizzle-kit migrate (Neon driver cannot connect to local PostgreSQL)
- [01-02]: Private note RLS uses RESTRICTIVE tenant + permissive author-only (AND logic)
- [01-02]: Junction table RLS via subquery JOIN to parent table for tenant isolation
- [01-03]: Used node-postgres (pg) for seed script instead of Neon driver (WebSocket not available locally)
- [01-03]: Deterministic UUIDs in seed data for idempotent re-runs via onConflictDoUpdate
- [01-03]: Seed connects as postgres superuser via SEED_DATABASE_URL to bypass RLS
- [Roadmap]: AI ships in v1 (phases 7-8), not deferred to v3 -- core product differentiator
- [Roadmap]: Phases 6, 7, 9 can execute in parallel after Phase 5 (all depend only on Phase 5)
- [Roadmap]: Google Calendar integration deferred to v2 per REQUIREMENTS.md (not in v1 scope)
- [Roadmap]: Design-first approach applied per-phase (mockups within each phase's plans, not a separate phase)
- [02-01]: Auth.js adapter requires exact column names: added 'name' and 'emailVerified' to user table
- [02-01]: Accounts table uses snake_case property names to match @auth/drizzle-adapter type expectations
- [02-01]: DrizzleAdapter cast to NextAuthConfig['adapter'] for @auth/core version mismatch workaround
- [02-01]: Resend client lazy-initialized to prevent build-time errors when API key is not set
- [02-01]: Token tables have no RLS -- accessed in unauthenticated flows (registration, password reset)
- [02-01]: OAuth sign-in blocked for users without existing records (must register org with credentials first)
- [02-02]: proxy.ts uses Next.js 16 convention (export const proxy) -- confirmed server looks for proxy first, then middleware
- [02-02]: Dashboard layout validates session server-side as defense-in-depth (CVE-2025-29927 mitigation)
- [02-02]: emailVerified added to JWT/session for verification status display in dashboard
- [02-03]: org_type is a dedicated column, not JSONB settings — structural property affecting business logic
- [02-03]: All auth flows use server actions with server-side redirects — no client-side next-auth/react URL construction
- [02-03]: trustHost: true in Auth.js config + X-Forwarded-Host/Proto reading in proxy.ts for reverse proxy
- [02-03]: Switched from Resend to nodemailer — works with any SMTP provider (smtp2go)
- [02-03]: Email base URLs derived from request headers, not hardcoded NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- [02-03]: orgType immutable after registration (set once, read-only in settings page)
- [03-01]: audit_log is immutable: RLS policies allow SELECT/INSERT only, no UPDATE/DELETE
- [03-01]: invite_token has no DELETE RLS policy: invites expire or get accepted, never deleted
- [03-01]: TransactionClient type exported from tenant-context.ts for audit helper reuse
- [03-01]: Sidebar has three nav items: Overview, People, Settings (minimal for v1)
- [Phase 03]: Accept endpoint uses adminDb with manual SET LOCAL for RLS (no session for unauthenticated users)
- [Phase 03]: Email verified automatically on invite acceptance (trusted invite link)
- [Phase 03]: 2-step wizard validates password fields before advancing to profile step
- [03-03]: Client-side filtering for v1: Server Component fetches all users, TanStack Table handles sorting/filtering/pagination
- [03-03]: URL-based tab navigation: /people for People tab, /teams for Teams tab
- [03-03]: Profile editing on dedicated page, ProfileSheet is read-only quick view
- [03-03]: PATCH endpoint dispatches on body keys (role, managerId, isActive, profile fields)
- [03-04]: Sidebar restructured with Settings section header and role-based visibility via useSession
- [03-04]: Audit log uses server-side pagination (page/limit params) -- audit logs grow large over time
- [03-04]: Team detail page splits Server Component (data fetch) and Client Component (interactivity)

- [04-01]: Soft-delete pattern for templates: is_archived=true, never actual row deletion (preserves session history)
- [04-01]: Answer config validation at API level: multiple_choice enforces min 2 non-empty string options
- [04-01]: Template list uses LEFT JOIN with COUNT for question counts, filtering archived questions
- [04-01]: DELETE endpoint on templates is archive (soft-delete), unsetting is_default if needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 7]: Google App Verification for calendar OAuth scopes takes 2-4 weeks -- initiate early if calendar moves to v1
- [Phase 1]: Neon default role has BYPASSRLS -- must create dedicated app role before any tenant data is written (RESOLVED: app_user created in 01-01, granted in 01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Private note key_version field missing from existing docs/data-model.md schema -- must be added (RESOLVED: added in 01-02 schema)
- [Phase 1]: drizzle-kit migrate does not work with local PostgreSQL (Neon driver requires WebSocket) -- use psql for local migrations
