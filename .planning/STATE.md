## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Full v1.0 decisions in `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- [v1.1 roadmap revised]: Consolidated 8 phases into 4 -- Phase 12 is the big phase (16 requirements: all UI strings + formatting + validation errors)
- [v1.1 roadmap revised]: Phases 12 and 13 parallelizable after Phase 11; Phase 14 gates on both
- [v1.1 roadmap]: Single dependency: next-intl v4 (no date-fns, no translation platform)
- [11-01]: Manual migration SQL instead of drizzle-kit generate (interactive prompts incompatible with automation)
- [11-01]: Accept-Language parsing uses 2-char extraction for simplicity
- [11-01]: NEXT_LOCALE cookie maxAge set to 1 year
- [11-02]: Hidden <data> element for formatting proof (no visual impact on login page)
- [11-02]: Language names as proper nouns (English, Romana) not translated -- standard i18n convention
- [11-02]: Full page reload after language switch (server-side message loading requires fresh request)
