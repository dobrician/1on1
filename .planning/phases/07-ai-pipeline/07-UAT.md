## Current Test

number: 3
name: AI Summary Section on Session Summary
expected: |
  On a completed session's summary page, the AI summary section renders with structured content: key takeaways, discussion highlights, follow-up items, and a sentiment badge. If AI hasn't completed yet, a skeleton loading state shows. If AI failed, a "Retry" button appears.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Dashboard Overview — Nudge Cards (Manager)
expected: Navigate to dashboard overview. As a manager with upcoming sessions, nudge cards should appear grouped by report name with priority dots, coaching text, and dismiss buttons. Empty state if no nudges generated yet.
result: issue
reported: "i have completed a few sessions, however, on the dashboard i get this: No AI nudges yet -- they appear after your first completed session"
severity: major

### 2. Session Completion Triggers AI Pipeline
expected: Complete a session through the wizard. After submission, you're redirected to the session summary page. The AI summary section should immediately show a loading skeleton/spinner state (aiStatus = "pending"), indicating the background pipeline was triggered.
result: issue
reported: "i just finished a session, and now, the view session page is showing AI Suggestions and other content as 'Generating...' even though it's been about 10 minutes. On the dashboard, i still get the same message: No AI nudges yet -- they appear after your first completed session"
severity: major

### 3. AI Summary Section on Session Summary
expected: On a completed session's summary page, the AI summary section renders with structured content: key takeaways, discussion highlights, follow-up items, and a sentiment badge. If AI hasn't completed yet, a skeleton loading state shows. If AI failed, a "Retry" button appears.
result: [pending]

### 4. AI Manager Addendum (Manager View)
expected: As the manager on a completed session, the summary page shows an additional "Manager Addendum" section below the AI summary. This section contains AI-generated private coaching insights visible only to the manager. Members/reports should NOT see this section.
result: [pending]

### 5. AI Action Item Suggestions
expected: On a completed session's summary page, an AI suggestions section shows suggested action items. Each suggestion has three controls: "Accept" (creates real action item), "Edit + Accept" (opens inline edit form then creates), and "Skip" (permanently removes the suggestion).
result: [pending]

### 6. Wizard Context Panel — Nudge Section (Manager)
expected: Open the session wizard as a manager. The context panel (right sidebar) should show a "Nudges" section as its first element, listing coaching nudges relevant to this series. Each nudge can be dismissed. Members/reports should NOT see the nudge section.
result: [pending]

### 7. Inngest Serve Route
expected: Navigate to /api/inngest in the browser. The endpoint should respond (Inngest UI or JSON response), confirming the serve route is active and functions are registered.
result: [pending]
