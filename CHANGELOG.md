## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Logo replaces plain "1on1" text in top nav, mobile sheet, sidebar, and auth layout
- Favicon (ICO), apple-icon (PNG), and icon (SVG) generated from vectorized logo
- `--logo-color` defaults to dark olive green, switches to lighter olive in dark mode, and matches `--primary` when a color theme is active
- Edit series dialog on series detail page — change cadence, preferred day/time, duration, and next session date directly
- `nextSessionAt` field added to series update API for direct date override
- Dashboard upcoming sessions now reuses `SeriesCard` component (same cards as sessions page), limited to next 3 active series
- Star rating display on series cards — amber filled stars for scored sessions, gray empty stars when no rating; numeric score appears on hover
- Score history sparkline area chart as subtle background on series cards (bottom 30% of card)
- AI session summary on series cards — `cardBlurb` (1-2 sentence plain-language blurb) with colored sentiment dot: green for positive, amber for neutral/mixed, red for concerning; grayed italic placeholder before first session completes
- Human-readable schedule label in bottom-right of series cards (e.g. "Weekly on Mondays at 11:30" / "Săptămânal, lunea la 11:30")
- Shared `getSeriesCardData()` query in `src/lib/queries/series.ts` used by sessions page, dashboard, and API route
- `cardBlurb` field added to `AISummary` schema — generated alongside session summary at pipeline completion

- Translation keys for template builder: `questionCard`, `answerConfig`, `conditionalLogic` namespaces in EN/RO

### Fixed
- Session-started toast in series-card and upcoming-sessions now uses translated text instead of hardcoded English
- summary-screen error toast now uses `showApiError()` for translated API errors instead of raw `error.message`
- Score display in five session components (summary-screen, context-panel, recap-screen, floating-context-widgets, session-summary-view) now uses locale-aware `format.number()` instead of `.toFixed(1)`
- Quick stats sparkline charts nearly invisible in dark mode — increased opacity from 8% to 25%

### Changed
- Dashboard page width now matches all other pages (removed `max-w-5xl` constraint)
- Series cards: preferred day/time and cadence merged into single human-readable schedule line in bottom-right
- Series cards: start/resume button aligned flush with card edge via negative margins compensating ghost button padding
- Session wizard context panel, recap screen, talking points, action items inline, nudge list, AI suggestions, and AI summary sections now use `useTranslations` for all visible strings
- All session date formatting replaced with locale-aware `useFormatter().dateTime()` across wizard-top-bar, context-panel, floating-context-widgets, summary-screen, session-summary-view, question-history-dialog (no hardcoded `toLocaleDateString("en-US")` remains)
