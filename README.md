# 1on1

**Structured one-on-one meeting management platform for companies.**

A SaaS application that helps organizations run effective, data-driven 1:1 meetings between managers and their direct reports. Unlike general-purpose meeting tools, 1on1 focuses on structured questionnaire-based sessions with longitudinal analytics — enabling companies to track employee engagement, wellbeing, and performance over months and years.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Structured sessions**: Customizable questionnaire templates with multiple answer types (ratings, scales, text, mood) that produce quantifiable data
- **Historical context**: Every session surfaces past notes, action items, and score trends so managers walk in prepared
- **Long-term analytics**: Track engagement, wellbeing, and performance scores over time — ready for annual reviews and salary negotiations
- **Company-configurable**: Each organization defines its own teams, questionnaires, and evaluation criteria

### Wiki Sync

The wiki source of truth lives in `docs/wiki/`. Changes are automatically synced to the GitHub Wiki via the `sync-wiki` GitHub Actions workflow on every push to `main` that modifies `docs/wiki/**`. You can also trigger it manually from the Actions tab.

For local sync (requires SSH key or PAT — the `gh` CLI OAuth token does not support wiki repos):

```bash
./scripts/sync-wiki.sh
```
