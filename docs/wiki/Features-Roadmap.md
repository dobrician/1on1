## MVP (v1) — Core Product

The minimum viable product delivers structured 1:1 sessions with quantifiable answers and historical tracking.

### 1. Company Onboarding & Multi-tenancy
- Company registration (name, slug, admin email, password)
- Tenant isolation via `tenant_id` + RLS
- Company settings: timezone, default cadence, default duration
- Admin configures company-level defaults

### 2. User Management
- Invite system: admin invites via email → magic link → set password
- User profiles: first/last name, email, job title, avatar
- Roles: Admin (full access), Manager (conducts 1:1s), Member (participates)
- Org chart: `manager_id` establishes reporting lines
- Deactivation: soft-delete preserving historical data

### 3. Team Management
- CRUD teams: name, description, manager
- Assign/remove members, team roles (lead/member)
- Users can belong to multiple teams

### 4. Questionnaire Template Builder
- Template CRUD: create, edit, duplicate, archive
- 6 question types: free text, rating 1-5, rating 1-10, yes/no, multiple choice, mood
- Question config: required/optional, help text, display order, categories
- Template versioning (version increments, past sessions preserved)
- Default template marking, drag-and-drop reordering

### 5. Meeting Series
- Create 1:1 relationships (manager + report)
- Cadence: weekly, biweekly, monthly, custom
- Default template per series, preferred day/time
- Series lifecycle: active → paused → archived
- Auto-generation of next session date

### 6. Session Wizard (Core Experience)
**Pre-session**: scheduled on dashboard, both parties add talking points

**During session**:
- Step-by-step question flow (grouped by category)
- Progress indicator, context panel (past 3 sessions, open action items, sparkline)
- Answer input widgets per type
- Shared notes (rich text), private notes (encrypted), action item creation inline
- Talking point checklist, navigation (prev/next + direct jump), auto-save

**Post-session**: summary screen, session score, mark complete, email summary

### 7. Action Items
- Create: title, description, assignee, due date
- Status: open → in progress → completed / cancelled
- Visible in context panel, dedicated list view, carry-over flagging

### 8. Manager Dashboard
- Upcoming sessions (next 7 days)
- Overdue action items grouped by report
- Quick stats: total reports, sessions this month, avg score
- Recent sessions, quick start button

### 9. Session History & Search

- Read-only completed session detail
- Full-text search across notes and talking points
- Filters: date range, status, report

### 10. Basic Analytics
