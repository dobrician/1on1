# 1on1 — Structured One-on-One Meeting Management

A SaaS platform that helps organizations run effective, data-driven 1:1 meetings between managers and their direct reports. Unlike general-purpose meeting tools, 1on1 focuses on structured questionnaire-based sessions with longitudinal analytics — enabling companies to track employee engagement, wellbeing, and performance over months and years.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Structured sessions** — Customizable questionnaire templates with multiple answer types (ratings, scales, text, mood) that produce quantifiable data
- **Historical context** — Every session surfaces past notes, action items, and score trends so managers walk in prepared
- **Long-term analytics** — Track engagement, wellbeing, and performance scores over time for annual reviews and salary negotiations
- **Company-configurable** — Each organization defines its own teams, questionnaires, and evaluation criteria
