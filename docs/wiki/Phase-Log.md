# Phase Log

## Overview

Implementation follows a phase-based roadmap managed via the [GSD workflow](https://github.com/cyanheads/claude-gsd). Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability. Phases execute sequentially with some parallelization opportunities after Phase 5.

**Total phases**: 10
**Completed**: 10/10 (All phases)
**Current**: Milestone v1.0 complete

## Execution Order

Phases execute in numeric order with parallelization after Phase 5:

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
  └── Phase 2 (Auth)
        └── Phase 3 (Users & Teams)
              └── Phase 4 (Templates)
                    └── Phase 5 (Series & Wizard)
                          ├── Phase 6 (Action Items)
                          ├── Phase 7 (AI Pipeline)     ← parallel
                          └── Phase 9 (Email)
                                │
                          Phase 6 + 7 ──► Phase 8 (Dashboard & Analytics)
                          Phase 8 + 9 ──► Phase 10 (Polish)
```

Phases 6, 7, and 9 all depend only on Phase 5 and can execute in parallel. Phase 8 requires both 6 and 7. Phase 10 requires 8 and 9.

## Conventions

- Each phase page lists **Goal**, **Success Criteria**, **Plans**, and **Key Decisions**
- Success criteria are testable conditions that define "done"
- Completed phases include what was built and key files created
- Phase plans are tracked in `.planning/phases/{phase-name}/` in the repo
