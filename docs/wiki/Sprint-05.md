# Sprint 05 — Team Management

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: Sprint 04
**Parallelizable with**: Sprint 06

**Status**: Not Started

## Goals

Implement team CRUD, team membership management, team roles, and update the people directory to show team affiliations.

## Deliverables

- [ ] **Team list page**: all teams with member count, manager name
- [ ] **Team detail page**: team info, member list, add/remove members
- [ ] **Team CRUD**:
   - Create team: name, description, manager
   - Edit team: name, description, change manager
   - Delete team (only if no active series reference it)
- [ ] **Membership management**:
   - Add members to team (search by name/email)
   - Remove members from team
   - Set team role (lead/member)
   - One user can belong to multiple teams
- [ ] **People directory enhancement**: show team badges on user cards
- [ ] **API routes**: `GET/POST /api/teams`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/teams/[id]`, `POST/DELETE /api/teams/[id]/members`
- [ ] **Zod schemas**: team creation, team update, membership management
