# Sprint 09 — Session Wizard — Context & Notes

**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: Sprint 08

**Status**: Not Started

## Goals

Complete the session wizard with the context panel (past sessions, action items, score trends), shared and private notes, talking points, and the post-session summary view.

## Deliverables

- [ ] **Context panel** (right sidebar during wizard):
   - Past 3 sessions: score, mood, notes excerpt (collapsible cards)
   - Open action items from past sessions with overdue indicators
   - Score trend sparkline (last 6 sessions)
- [ ] **Shared notes**:
   - Rich text editor visible on every wizard step
   - Both manager and report can edit
   - Auto-save with debounce
- [ ] **Private notes**:
   - Separate text area with visual indicator (different background color)
   - Toggle between shared and private modes
   - Encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM via tenant key)
   - Only visible to the author
- [ ] **Talking points**:
   - Pre-session: both parties can add talking points
   - During session: check off as discussed
   - Display carried-over points from previous sessions
   - Add new talking points during session
- [ ] **Post-session summary** (`/sessions/[id]/summary`):
   - All answers grouped by category
   - Shared notes
   - Action items (new + open from past)
   - Talking points (discussed + undiscussed)
   - Duration, session score
   - [Complete] and [Send Summary Email] buttons
- [ ] **API routes**: `POST/GET /api/sessions/[id]/notes`, `POST/GET/PUT /api/sessions/[id]/talking-points`, `GET /api/sessions/[id]/context`
