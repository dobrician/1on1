## Conventions

- Each sprint page lists **Goals**, **Deliverables**, **Acceptance Criteria**, and **Key Files**
- Acceptance criteria are testable conditions that define "done"
- Key files list the primary files/directories that will be created or modified
- Sprints 05 and 06 can run in parallel if two developers are available
- Sprints 11 and 12 can run in parallel
- Sprints 13 and 14 can run in parallel
