 * Model configuration per AI task.

 * Mapping task -> model tier optimizes the quality/cost balance:
 * - Summaries need quality and nuance -> Sonnet
 * - Manager addendum needs nuance for sentiment -> Sonnet
 * - Nudges are shorter, simpler -> Haiku (cost-effective)
 * - Action suggestions need accuracy -> Sonnet
 * - Template editor needs highest quality for expert domain reasoning -> Sonnet 4.6
 *
 * Switching models is a single-line change here.
